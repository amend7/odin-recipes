    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Flan:</h3>
    <p><ul>
        <li>1 cup cajeta or caramel sauce</li>
        <li>1 can (12 oz) evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h3>Cake:</h3>
    <p><ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. </li>
        <li>Prepare the flan: Pour the cajeta into a 10-cup capacity Bundt pan and use a spatula to spread it out. </li>
        <li>In a blender, combine the evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, eggs, and vanilla extract. Blend until smooth. Pour into the prepared Bundt pan. </li>
        <li>Prepare the cake: In a medium bowl, sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and baking powder. </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar together. Add the eggs and vanilla extract and beat until light and fluffy. </li>
        <li>Alternately add the dry ingredients and the buttermilk to the butter mixture, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Do not overmix. </li>
        <li>Pour the cake batter over the flan mixture. Cover the Bundt pan with foil and place it in a large roasting pan. Create a water bath by adding enough hot water to the roasting pan to reach halfway up the sides of the Bundt pan. </li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the roasting pan to the oven and bake for 1 hour and 45 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. </li>
        <li>Remove the Bundt pan from the water bath and let it cool to room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. </li>
        <li>To unmold, run a knife around the edges of the pan and invert the cake onto a large rimmed platter. </li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
